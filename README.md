# Student Performance Analysis System
Hi, I'm Bhumika Dinesh Chitte, a Third-year student of Computer Engineering (BE) @ Amrutvahini College of Engineering Sangamner, and this is my project on Student Performance Analysis.

This project is part of my academic work during ZENSAR training session in Computer Engineering (BE). The idea behind this project is to create a system that helps in managing student records, calculating GPAs, and analyzing performance based on grades.

# Project Description:  
Store student data: Information about students, courses, grades.  
Calculate GPA: Using PL/SQL subqueries, it computes GPA by considering the grades and credits of courses.  
Generate Reports: The project can generate Grade Distribution Reports to get deeper insights.  
Notify Student: Automatically Student will be Notify When any Updatation will be occurs on marks and grade.  
Database Schema:  
1)Student: Stores student details.  
2)Courses: Stores course details with credits.  
3)Grades: Stores grades assigned to students.  
# SQL Files  
I have created separate .sql files for each module to keep the code organized:  
1)table_structure_creation.sql – Contains the SQL commands for creating the database schema, including the Student, Courses, and Grades tables.  
2)data_insertion.sql – Includes SQL queries to insert sample data into the tables.  
3)gpa_calculation.sql – Provides the PL/SQL queries to calculate the GPA using subqueries.  
4)grade_changes_notification.sql – Implements triggers to notify students of grade changes.  
5)grade_report_generation.sql – Contains the PL/SQL procedures to generate Grade Distribution Reports.

Thank you!
